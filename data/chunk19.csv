95044,Austria,"Hints of moss, yeast and freshly zested orange peel edged with pine honey initially suggest a dry wine. It is only on the palate that the richer and sweeter Auslese character comes to bear—again in the guise of dark, aromatic pine honey. The concentrated, deliciously bitter zestiness of the acidity, paired with the aromatically dark and equally bitter edge of the resinous honey provide a wonderful structure. While sweetness peaks up, it never gains the upper hand. This is a tight-rope walker of a wine with immense balance and poise. Glints of vanilla pod, candied peel and white pepper open up, vista after vista.

99989,US,"Though excessively foamy, once it settles down this wine has a pretty pale copper shade, and a hint of strawberry and cherry in the fruit flavor. It's dry and delicate, with a clean, persistent finish.",Blanc de Noirs,87,11.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Domaine Ste. Michelle NV Blanc de Noirs Sparkling (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sparkling Blend,Domaine Ste. Michelle
99990,Argentina,"Jammy and dark, with big berry and coffee aromas. The palate has a hard intensity to it that I haven't seen before from this wine, with bitterness along with black cherry, chocolate and toasty flavors. It's forward, firm and driving, but always hard and angular. In its defense, 2008 was a cool, difficult year with frosts at harvest time.",Ultra,87,24.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Kaiken 2008 Ultra Malbec (Mendoza),Malbec,Kaiken
99991,Italy,"Here's a fresh, crisp and tonic Moscato d'Asti (packaged in an elegant, little bottle) that shows nice floral intensity and background aromas of peach and almond skin. It tastes sweet and smooth and those perky bubbles help refresh the palate.",Nivole 375ml,87,,Piedmont,Moscato d'Asti,,,,Michele Chiarlo 2009 Nivole 375ml  (Moscato d'Asti),Moscato,Michele Chiarlo
99992,US,"Overly sharp acidity marks this wine, giving it a cutting mouthfeel that interferes with otherwise delicious flavors. It sure is deep and long in blackberries, black currants, black licorice and smoky cedar wood, and the tannins are thick and dry, suggesting ageability.",,87,45.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Neal Family 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Neal Family
99993,Chile,"Chunky, rubbery and leathery on the nose, but there's plenty of berry fruit, too. For an $11 wine, the palate is lush and plump, with big tannins and full flavors of roasted cherry, plum, herbs and tomato. Finishes long and persistent, but fresh. Interesting and nicely done for Chilean Cab Franc.",Cabernet Franc Carmenère,87,11.0,Central Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,oops 2008 Cabernet Franc Carmenère Red (Central Valley),Red Blend,oops
99994,Argentina,"Could the scent of microwaved popcorn be any stronger? Obviously, it's heavily oaked, and that carries onto the palate where you'll find heavy, woody flavors in addition to banana and lemon. This needs a lot more charm and style; in all honesty, it's not delivering much.",,80,8.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Bodega Norton 1999 Chardonnay (Mendoza),Chardonnay,Bodega Norton
99995,Chile,"This one has bland aromatics, with only a touch of oak to grasp at. The palate is almost spritzy, which it shouldn't be, and the flavor resembles Mott's applesauce. A bit weak and only qualifies for an acceptable rating on its best day.",,80,8.0,Curicó Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Millaman 2000 Chardonnay (Curicó Valley),Chardonnay,Millaman
99996,Chile,"The nose is sulphuric and a bit barnyardy, which screams“watch out,” but in the mouth there's acceptable if unspectacular apple fruit. It's scratchy in the finish, and probably just this side of not being worth drinking.",Estate,80,6.0,Maipo Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Santa Alicia 2001 Estate Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),Chardonnay,Santa Alicia
99997,Argentina,"Clear as day in the glass, with forced oak and spring flowers in the nose. In a word, it's strange. In the mouth, you'll get sweetness and other flavors not generally associated with Chardonnay. It's not necessarily a bad white wine, but it is definitely at odds with typical Chardonnay.",Elsa,80,11.0,Mendoza Province,San Rafael,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Valentin Bianchi 2001 Elsa Chardonnay (San Rafael),Chardonnay,Valentin Bianchi
99998,Argentina,"To get the best results, you'd better chill this one down. That way you'll get more of the refreshing apple and pear element of the wine and less of its fat, chunky body and rough, unpolished edges.",,80,11.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Marcus James 2000 Chardonnay (Mendoza),Chardonnay,Marcus James
99999,Chile,"Another wine from Portal del Alto that's just on the cusp of drinkability. Potent butterscotch and cream aromas don't seem authentic. Resiny flavors mask the fruit, and it finishes flat.",Gran Reserva,80,12.0,Maipo Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Portal Del Alto 2000 Gran Reserva Chardonnay (Maipo Valley),Chardonnay,Portal Del Alto
