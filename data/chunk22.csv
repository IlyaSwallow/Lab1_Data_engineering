114986,US,"An ethereally lithe and elegant wine, the aromatic profile and exuberance on the palate suggest savory and spicy specks of pomegranate, cranberry and even rhubarb. It's fresh, structured and well-integrated, with a bite of bark and clove on the rounded finish.",Suacci Vineyard,94,48.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Zepaltas 2013 Suacci Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Pinot Noir,Zepaltas
114987,Spain,"Forget about Sherry styles, Matusalem operates in its own zone with its own rules. An intense, smoky nose shows charred barrel notes and prune aromas. A rich but snappy palate is not the least bit sticky, while deep flavors of chocolate, coffee, vanilla and molasses finish with grace.",Matusalem Vinum Optimum Rare Signatum,94,50.0,Andalucia,Jerez,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,González Byass NV Matusalem Vinum Optimum Rare Signatum Sherry (Jerez),Sherry,González Byass
114988,US,"It's easy to appreciate this wine's generous, almost jammy aromas. They're followed by spicy, concentrated black-cherry flavors backed by firm acidity and lots of fine-grained tannins. This wine, from a vineyard owned by Williams-Selyem co-founder Burt Williams, tastes terrific now, but will show more complexity with time. Try to save it until at least 2018.",Burt Williams' Morning Dew Ranch,94,78.0,California,Anderson Valley,,Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,Williams Selyem 2013 Burt Williams' Morning Dew Ranch Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley),Pinot Noir,Williams Selyem
114989,France,"This wine is young, surprisingly fruity at this stage for this normally textured, structured Grand Cru. A pure line of sliced apple and green-plum flavors are shot through with tangy acidity. The fruitiness and intense acidity will pass soon and the wine will develop the proper steely, tight and mineral character. It will drink at its best from 2020.",Les Clos Grand Cru,94,70.0,Burgundy,Chablis,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Domaine Louis Moreau 2014 Les Clos Grand Cru  (Chablis),Chardonnay,Domaine Louis Moreau
114990,US,"Pure purple aromas of boysenberry jam and Concord grapes swirl amidst melted dark chocolate, maple-drizzled bacon and touches of beef carpaccio on the nose of this bottling from a coveted vineyard. Starting with strong blueberry and blackberry fruit, the palate then sizzles with acidity through the fine-grained tannic structure. The midpalate shows meaty depth with roasting herbs and minty lift throughout.",Russell Family Vineyard,94,55.0,California,Paso Robles Willow Creek District,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,Nicora 2013 Russell Family Vineyard Syrah (Paso Robles Willow Creek District),Syrah,Nicora
114991,Italy,"Enticing scents of rose, fragrant blue flower, perfumed berry and chopped herb take center stage. Combining structure and finesse, the palate doles out juicy wild cherry, raspberry, cinnamon, mint and star anise while firm, polished tannins provide the framework.

114992,Italy,"Aromas of menthol, star anise, clove and mature berry unfold in the glass. The firmly structured palate offers mature black cherry, star anise, espresso and a touch of exotic spice framed in taut, fine-grained tannins that lend elegance.

114993,France,"Grown on two parcels of 60- and 80-year-old vines, this is a dense, impressively concentrated wine. It has rich white fruits cut with citrus, as well as a firmer, more mineral character that sets the wine on the road to aging. This structured wine will be best from 2019.",Les L-O,94,35.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Michel Vattan 2014 Les L-O  (Sancerre),Sauvignon Blanc,Michel Vattan
114994,US,"Elegant purple flower, black cherry fruit, a bouquet of white sage and a touch of graphite decorate the rich and vibrant nose of this wine by Adam Lee.

114995,Spain,"Raisin and more raisin aromas come with touches of cinnamon, caramel and molasses. This feels viscous but not gooey, and thus it's just right as P. X. goes.

114996,France,"Dried spices, cracked pepper and roasted meat notes scream of Syrah and the Northern Rhône. It's medium to full in body, but with fine tannins and bright acidity, making it remarkably easy to drink. Approachable now, it should still be drinking well through 2030.",Terres Brulées,94,48.0,Rhône Valley,Cornas,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Jean-Luc Colombo 2011 Terres Brulées  (Cornas),Syrah,Jean-Luc Colombo
114997,France,"In hommage to the man who pioneered the use of oak to ferment Sauvignon Blanc, this wood-fermented and matured wine is only produced in the best years. It is rich and just toasty, but equally about the structured mineral texture and ripe citrus. It is a wine to age, so drink from 2018.",Etienne Henri,94,65.0,Loire Valley,Sancerre,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Henri Bourgeois 2013 Etienne Henri  (Sancerre),Sauvignon Blanc,Henri Bourgeois

114999,France,"Close to the village of Aloxe-Corton, this vineyard is one of the smallest of the Corton grand crus. This wine, still fresh while also closed up with tannins, is dark, structured and has the potential to age many years. Intense red-berry acidity and a tight, dry core still convey youthfulness.
