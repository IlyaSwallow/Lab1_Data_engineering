79998,US,"Distinctive aromatic qualities mark this afforable bottling, an exclusive for Hawaiian supermarket chain Foodland from the team at Terravant Wine Company in Buellton. The aromas recall chaparral scrub, mint tea and black sage. The herbaceousness continues on the palate, with a sticky tannic structure. Not exactly the wine for those seeking a red fruit experience, but good for those seeking the savory side of the grape.",,91,23.0,California,Santa Barbara County,Central Coast,Matt Kettmann,@mattkettmann,Ternion 2011 Pinot Noir (Santa Barbara County),Pinot Noir,Ternion
79999,Germany,"This wine shows the riper, spicier side to German Pinot Noir. Lush black cherry and plum flavors are fleshy and dense on the palate, tinged with notes of cassis and bramble. Crisp acidity adds elegance and structure, along with a penetrating layer of finely textured tannins. Drink now for its bold, decadent style.",Saulheimer Kalkstein Trocken,91,30.0,Rheinhessen,,,Anna Lee C.
