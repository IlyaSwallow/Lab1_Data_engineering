84981,Portugal,"This is the entry-level wine from Vallado, bright and fruity, with an attractive red-berry flavor and a solid, tannic core. As is typical with the 2010 vintage, it has some structure and should be aged for another year.",Vallado,88,20.0,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Quinta do Vallado 2010 Vallado Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Quinta do Vallado
84982,France,"This full-bodied wine is packed with citrus and tight, apple-driven acidity, as well as a rich touch of apricot. This fruitiness is balanced by a deliciously refreshing character that creates texture and a steely, minerally feel.",Expression Brut,88,50.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,René Geoffroy NV Expression Brut  (Champagne),Champagne Blend,René Geoffroy
84983,Chile,"A unique wine with a proprietary Elqui imprint, this smells balsamic-y and tomatoey, with a rooty, earthy undercurrent. It feels grabby and full bodied, with tomato, boysenberry and green tobacco flavors. It holds onto that ashy tobacco character on the full-force finish.",Kankana del Elqui,88,44.0,Elqui Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,San Pedro 2009 Kankana del Elqui Syrah (Elqui Valley),Syrah,San Pedro
84984,Italy,"There's a modern, velvety touch to this blend of indigenous grapes (Magliocco, Montonico Nero and Greco) that are cultivated in one of the most isolated spots in southern Italy.

84985,US,"Ripe and seemingly sweet fruit, oak and spice characterize this rich, delicious Petite Sirah. It shows the variety's strong tannins, but here they're soft and melted.

84987,US,"Quite dry and reaching just 12% alcohol, this smells of rose petal and lychee fruit.

84988,US,"This is a bit hard and aggressive now, with a punch of green tannins. That makes it hard to appreciate the underlying oaky, ripe blackberry and currant fruit. It doesn't seem to have the inherent balance necessary for aging, so give it a decanting and drink it now.",,88,70.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Joseph Cellars 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Joseph Cellars

84990,US,"This pleasing effort is light but interesting. It first introduces flavors of strawberry and rhubarb, with a dash of pepper.

84991,US,"This marks a real departure for Michael David, a producer that tends to make its wines big and bold. This soft, hardly oaked, lightly tannic Cinsault is from a very special old vineyard.

84996,Croatia,"Aeration is key to deciphering the layers of barnyard, leather, earth and tannin that dominate the attack of this brawny, bold wine. With time, a multitude of delicate red-fruit, flower and hay notes unfold, contributing a feminine flair that's elegantly appealing.",,88,25.0,Peljesac,,,Anna Lee C. Iijima,,Frano Milos 2008 Plavac Mali (Peljesac),Plavac Mali,Frano Milos

84999,France,"This full-bodied offering is ripe and richly balanced. A predominance of the two Pinots gives it an intense fruitiness, with raspberry and red apple notes dominating. At the same time, there is a fine, mineral-driven tautness that gives it a final, crisp bite. Disgorged February 2012.",Brut Réserve Grand Cru,88,56.0,Champagne,Champagne,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,H.
