100001,France,"Chapoutier's selections of the best parcels of vines in Hermitage are set to become legendary. Sold under the ancient spelling of the appellation name (Ermitage), they represent the epitome of the power and concentration that lies behind the reputation of the appellation. This cuvée is the best of the collection, with its brooding, opaque character, suggesting rather than revealing power at this stage. Age it until your new-born baby is old enough to drink, and it will be just about ready.",Le Méal Ermitage,98,150.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,M.

100002,France,"Jean-Louis, the son of Gérard Chave, is now in charge of the family business, as well as being president of the Hermitage wine producers. He is continuing the family tradition of making powerful statements of Syrah from Hermitage, combining massive structure and over-powering perfumes. This 1999 seems to have the best of the traditional world of tannic immensity and the modern world of beautiful, ripe fruit. A wine that will age for a very long time.",,97,125.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,J.L. Chave 1999  Hermitage,Rhône-style Red Blend,J.L. Chave
100003,US,"Aromas lean toward black cherry, chocolate and herbs, which sally forth on the palate serving up more dense fruit, licorice, coffee and beautiful toast flavors.

100004,US,"Certainly one of the successes of the vintage. Packed with cassis, sage, plum, tobacco, earth and smoky oak, and perfectly dry and balanced. Sheer joy in the mouth, like liquid velvet.

100006,France,"Even though the 42 months this wine has spent in new wood give it an intensely toasty character, the enormously soft, perfumed fruits and ripe, sweet flavors that go along with the wood produce a finely tuned, balanced wine that should age well over many years. As an expression of pure Syrah, there are few better.",La Mouline,96,175.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,E. Guigal 1998 La Mouline  (Côte Rôtie),Rhône-style Red Blend,E. Guigal
100007,US,"After “fiddling around,” as he puts it, with blends in his '96 and '97 cabs, winemaker Alex Golitzin decided to go with straight Cabernet in '98, an exceptional vintage for Washington State. This is a tight, focused effort, with powerful black fruits augmented with herbs and spices and a hint of mineral. Young, tart and tannic, it will continue to improve as it knits together over the years.

100008,France,"A firm, dry, foursquare wine that has power and structure rather than the immediate perfumes of La Mouline, the partner cuvée from Guigal. This is the wine for those who want power with big tannins, and they don't come more powerful or tannic than this. Its aging potential is enormous:  after 10 years there should be more sign of the perfumed fruit which is there, somewhere.",La Turque,95,175.0,Rhône Valley,Côte Rôtie,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,E.

100010,France,"A huge, ink-black wine with all the brooding majesty that gives Cornas its reputation. A blockbuster with enormous rich, sweet tannins.

100011,France,"A massive wine, with its opaque, dense purple color, its huge tannins and its tight, powerful structure. When it develops—maybe in 10 or 15 years' time—the perfumed, juicy Syrah fruits that are just suggested for the moment are going to be as dominant as the tannins are now. What a wine it will be then.",,95,55.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,E. Guigal 1999  Hermitage,Rhône-style Red Blend,E. Guigal
100012,US,"What a great success. Oozes with blackcurrant jam and cassis and a dash of black pepper. Flamboyant oak adds a perfume of vanilla and smoke.

100015,France,"Jaboulet's white Hermitage is named after the crusading knight who built and settled in the small chapel on the Hermitage hill. The wine itself is powerful, rich and concentrated, with heady perfumes of wild flowers and nuts.

100016,France,"Jaboulet's view of its most famous wine seems to have changed. Although the concentrated, dense tannins and big black fruit flavors are still there, it has lost the huge brooding presence of past vintages, and now has a veneer of sophistication with superripe fruit, plums and dark jam tastes. Whether this 1999 will age as well as older vintages remains to be seen, but it will certainly be ready to drink sooner.",La Chapelle,94,131.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Paul Jaboulet Aîné 1999 La Chapelle  (Hermitage),Rhône-style Red Blend,Paul Jaboulet Aîné
100017,US,"What power and drama have gone into this wonderful wine. Sheer Pomerol, with pencil shaving, black cherry, cedar, chocolate and gamy-meaty aromas and flavors, tinged with violets, and the most voluptuous mouthfeel. Sheer hedonism right through the long sweet finish.",,94,48.0,California,Napa-Sonoma,North Coast,,,Pride Mountain 1999 Merlot (Napa-Sonoma),Merlot,Pride Mountain
100018,France,"Old vines in the Les Bessards vineyard on the Hermitage hill have offered up a majestic wine that has considerable power. With its strong, firm tannins and intense, brooding dark fruits, this is a wine that has obviously been made to last. With little use of new wood for this wine (only 10%), the structure and the complexity come entirely from the enormously ripe fruit and traditional fermentation.",Les Bessards,94,98.0,Rhône Valley,Hermitage,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Delas Frères 1999 Les Bessards  (Hermitage),Rhône-style Red Blend,Delas Frères
100019,France,"The perfect combination of elegance and purity of fruit give this famous wine, a blend of fruit from both slopes of the hills above Ampuis, a great sense of style as well as power.

100020,US,"Hedges is one of a handful of Washington wineries producing top- caliber wines in significant quantities. This is their best deeply colored, elegant and Bordeaux-like in style and substance. Powerful, muscular black cherry fruit blends with dense, firm tannins, highlighted with elements of iron and earth.

100021,US,"A strong Cabernet that's so tightly wound in tannins, it's hard to appreciate, despite plenty of fruit. There's also a green olive earthiness to the sweet blackberries and cedar.

100025,New Zealand,"Plump and slightly sweet, this late-harvest Riesling comes in at 10% alcohol—something along the lines of a rich spätlese in terms of its alcohol-acid-sugar balance.

It has weight, although with its already exuberant fruitiness, it is not likely to be really long-term wine. Drink from 2024. From 120 acres, only the best grapes go into this top wine and 2013 was a smaller crop than the average (10,000 to 12,000 cases).

104974,US,"An unusual version of Pearl, this includes 9% Grenache Blanc and 5% Roussanne in the blend. Though it's labeled Sauvignon Blanc, those other grapes seem to command center stage, and the wine might as well be thought of as a creative white blend rather than a single variety. Pungent and herbal, it has well-knit and balanced green and yellow fruit flavors, with notes of caraway seed and grass.",Pearl,88,22.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Sparkman 2013 Pearl Sauvignon Blanc (Columbia Valley (WA)),Sauvignon Blanc,Sparkman
104975,US,"The Sweetwater block is the highest on the Rochioli estate, stretching into the hills. The wine is very concentrated in green apples, spicy Asian pears and insanely ripe summer peaches. It's quite oaky, with strong buttered toast notes, yet the oak is balanced with the fruit. A classy, flashy wine that drinks well now, and should develop in the bottle over the next 4–6 years.",Sweetwater,94,60.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,,,J.

104980,US,"There's something enormously satisfying about this Merlot-based blend. It hits the Napa-Bordeaux sweet spot, with concentrated blackberry and cherry fruit, jacketed in sweet, smoky oak. But there's also a fascinating olive character. The tannins are rich and dense and velvety. Great to experience now, and should be one for the long haul, perhaps through 2022.",Illustration,94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Blackbird Vineyards 2010 Illustration Red (Napa Valley),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Blackbird Vineyards
