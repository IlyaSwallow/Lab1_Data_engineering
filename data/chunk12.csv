60000,France,"A hint of smoke and a touch of earth precede the fresh lemon notes of the nose. The dry palate, with its vivid impression of very pure, bright and incisive lemon freshness, still seems tightly wound. There is something brooding and alive about this—it can be felt below the surface, disquieting but promising. This has barely started on its journey and will take a while to develop fully but it's all already there, dormant and ready to unfurl with a little more bottle age.

60001,US,"Clean lines of nectarine, lemon blossom, orange sorbet and wet rock show on the lovely nose of this bottling from Trey Fletcher. Boisterous energy and a chalky grip power the palate, where citrus freshness dominates, and the acidity is powerful but not overblown. It will age with beauty and grace.

60002,England,"Beautifully delineated fruit constitues the nose, with ripe, yellow plum playing alongside crisp, green apple. The palate layers a sonorous tone of sourdough bread with rich hints of yeast, green-apple briskness and gentle yellow plum. The notions unite with the fizzing, fine mousse. On the midpalate and the finish, the depth of this wine becomes clear: Profound and rich but in a totally slender, unassuming and convincing fashion. The finish is pure and lasting.

60003,France,"Definitely dry, this impressively crisp wine is tightly textured, mineral in character and with great fruit.

60005,US,"The nose of this bottling explodes with exotic cherry scents and compelling strokes of iron, rose, carnation and cinnamon. It's refreshingly tart and earthy on the palate, where dewy sage, mint and tarragon touches lift its youthful raspberry and green olive flavors.

60006,France,"The musky touch of botrytized fruit appears immediately, adding even more allure to the golden color. An explosion of golden apricot and luscious peach provide mouthfilling sweetness on the palate. All this is countered by very concentrated lemon freshness. This is not one of the tooth-achingly sweet SGNs—this is fresher and still has vivid fruit flavors. The finish has so much freshness it is lip-smacking. This will be a killer with fruit-centered desserts. Its sweetness-acid balance is of utter poise and a wonderful class act.

60009,France,"A lovely touch of orange zest teases the nose and there also is a lovely hint of chervil. The streamlined palate comes in with bundled citrus notes. The tart flesh of tangerine and the zest of lemon are softened and enriched with orange oil and ample concentration. This is pure and racy, linear and bold. There is something salty and energetic, something incredibly fresh and vibrant at the core. The palate and finish are absolutely dry, the echo is long and clean.

60010,US,"This new cuvée is sourced from a 2008 planting of the Swan clone, rare in Oregon. The aromatics are dazzling, with a lightly peppery, meaty aspect around slightly muted notes of herb and rock. The fruit is especially generous, with blackberry and boysenberry predominant.

60012,France,"A funky whiff of yeast has to blow off before wonderfully pure orange zest notes appear. The palate has a wonderful richness of texture, something earthy with a pithy, beautiful grip. The flavors are still taut, for now (just zesty aromatic orange peel) but much more still hides and sleeps below the surface. This is powerful and concentrated, with a lovely and enduring backbone of freshness. This needs bottle age to come into its own. The finish is fresh, clean and lasting.

60013,France,"The nose at first is all about aromatic orange zest but with a little more air there are lovely hints of jasmine and honeysuckle. The palate adds a judicious bitterness and counters this with residual sweetness. The counterpoint here is between texture and full fruit. This is incredibly powerful, as if some inner force was at work. This seems like a genie in a bottle—willful, driven and deliciously aromatic. The finish is off dry and long.

60015,France,"A touch of luscious peach plays among the ripe lemon notes of the nose. A heady chamomile lift hints at some evolution. The absolutely dry palate is still vividly fresh and has barely begun to unfurl its store of rich aromas. For now the luminous freshness and brightness of pure ripe lemon zest still dominates. Here and there a touch of candle wax, stone and chamomile appears. From the 2011, this has barely begun its journey. A lovely, incisive, intense but elegant wine with a clean refreshing finish.

60016,France,"Heady notes of chamomile and dried hay flower stream from the glass immediately hinting at a wine with some evolution. A touch of candied lemon peel makes the nose even more enticing. The palate is generous but dry, showing off the pristine pear fruit and wonderful phenolic texture that gives as much structure to this wine as its fine pure lemony acidity. Savored slowly, the full depth of pure pear fruit becomes apparent. This is a class act just coming into its drinking window now, with ample potential for further aging.

60017,France,"A tender but enticing touch of peach rises from the glass. There also is a glint of smoke and a touch of lemon zestiness. It is lemon and tangy citrus that takes over on the taut linear palate. Zestiness fizzes and gives the concentrated palate a wonderfully weightless feel that belies the depth of fruit. This is totally appetizing and refreshing with a dry, moreish finish.

60018,France,"A funky earthy touch hovers on the nose before hints of nettle and lemon balm add an aromatic edge to lemon freshness. On the exquisitely dry palate, it is the vivid, bright and intense lemon freshness that takes over, but those earthier notes still flash up around the edges, adding interest and depth. They will unfurl more as time passes. While this is linear, incisive and precise now, it will truly shine with bottle age.

A beautifully lithe and fluid synthesis of ripe and tart orchard fruits is leavened by bright citrus, green pear, Cox's apple and pure ripe Amalfi lemon. There also is a fine hint of discreet herbal lift—chamomile and chervil can be glimpsed here and there. What an aromatic, statuesque beauty.

The Ribbon Ridge AVA is a subset of a subset within the Willamette Valley, and it may be the hidden gem for producing great Pinot Noir. This wine is sensual, spirited, spicy and smooth. The cherry and raspberry fruit is highlighted with bright acidity and whiffs of baking spices.

64006,US,"Despite being nearly six years old, the tannins in this wine are still huge and hard. But the beautiful acidity and the incredibly intense fruity concentration suggests this has more time left to evolve in the bottle.

64983,Spain,"Briny, leesy aromas are funky and sweaty, not clean and lean like most Txakoli. Snappy, citric and decidedly not spritzy, this tastes of lemon, underripe nectarine and tart green apple. A cleansing seltzer-like finish is the closing act.",,85,20.0,Northern Spain,Getariako Txakolina,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Gaintza 2014 Hondarrabi Zuri (Getariako Txakolina),Hondarrabi Zuri,Gaintza
64984,Australia,"For the price, this is a remarkable achievement. It's a varietally correct, properly lightweight Pinot Noir imbued with attractive black cherry fruit. There's a charred-stave character that adds vanilla and a tinge of mocha as well. Drink now.",Reserve,85,13.0,South Australia,Adelaide Hills,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Jacob's Creek 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills),Pinot Noir,Jacob's Creek
64985,Spain,"Dusty, citrusy aromas of pineapple turn more tropical with airing. This is 60% Garnacha Blanca, 30% Chardonnay and 10% Sauvignon Blanc, and it's a bit flat on the palate. Flavors of white fruits are candied but also bitter, while this finishes with honeyed sweetness offset by pithy bitterness.",Almodí Petit,85,14.0,Catalonia,Terra Alta,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Altavins 2014 Almodí Petit White (Terra Alta),White Blend,Altavins
64986,US,"This wine has a slightly lighter color than usual, aromas that resemble black plums and red cherries, and similar flavors. It is medium bodied, moderately tannic in texture and a good choice for a large crowd.",Vineyard Selection,85,12.0,California,California,California Other,Jim Gordon,@gordone_cellars,Angel's Cup 2013 Vineyard Selection Cabernet Sauvignon (California),Cabernet Sauvignon,Angel's Cup
64987,France,"Quite pale, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot is soft, fruity and ready to drink. Attractive red fruits and light acidity give a tangy, fresh aftertaste.",Bélingard,85,12.0,Southwest France,Bergerac Rosé,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Château Bélingard 2014 Bélingard  (Bergerac Rosé),Rosé,Château Bélingard
64988,US,"This wine is from Talley, and while it's nowhere near as good as the parent company's Pinot Noir, it's not bad for the price. Shows a nice, silky texture with bright, juicy flavors of cherries, cranberries and toast.",,86,20.0,California,San Luis Obispo County,Central Coast,,,Bishop's Peak 2011 Pinot Noir (San Luis Obispo County),Pinot Noir,Bishop's Peak
64989,Spain,"This Tempranillo-Cabernet blend begins with scratchy, earthy aromas of moss, leather and herbal red fruits. It's alert and lively in the mouth, with strawberry, plum, raspberry and citrusy flavors. The finish hollows out and shows good length and a light structure.",Finca Rableros,86,15.0,Northern Spain,Somontano,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Bodega Otto Bestué 2009 Finca Rableros Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon (Somontano),Tempranillo-Cabernet Sauvignon,Bodega Otto Bestué
64990,France,"A firm, dark and concentrated wine that boasts big tannins, dark fruit and a seriously dry element. Powerful and extracted, it needs time to soften and show its more fruity side.",,86,,Bordeaux,Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Château la Grande Maye 2010  Castillon Côtes de Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château la Grande Maye
64991,South Africa,"Faint suggestions of fynbos and asparagus mingle with bright notes of orange peel, green plum and melon rind. Lively and easy, with good cut to the melon and plum flavors on the palate that end quickly but cleanly.",,86,20.0,Walker Bay,,,Lauren Buzzeo,@laurbuzz,Creation 2011 Sauvignon Blanc (Walker Bay),Sauvignon Blanc,Creation
64992,Spain,"This Cava is mustardy smelling, with apple in tow. The palate feels fresh and solid, while flavors of yeasty, dry apple and white pepper lead to a toasty, firm finish. A likable sparkler but regular as a whole.",Milesimé Brut Reserva,86,24.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Juvé y Camps 2008 Milesimé Brut Reserva Sparkling (Cava),Sparkling Blend,Juvé y Camps
64993,US,"Whiffs of toasted wood and cardamom lend a warm, spicy tone to concentrated black-fruit notes on this boldly tannic, structured Cab. Brisk acidity adds balance to fruit and body, highlighting delicate herb notes on the finish.",Reserve,86,28.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Anna Lee C. Iijima,,Keuka Spring 2010 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Cabernet Sauvignon,Keuka Spring
64994,US,"This Merlot is very fruity and forward with persistent berry jam, cassis, anise and mocha flavors. Although the tannins are brisk, it's a wine to drink now.",Estate Grown,86,35.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,,,Korbin Kameron 2009 Estate Grown Merlot (Sonoma Valley),Merlot,Korbin Kameron
64995,US,"This is appealing for its richness, but it's heavily oaked with buttered toast and butterscotch flavors that overwhelm the underlying fruit. Too bad, because it's a nice Chardonnay with bright pineapple and orange flavors supported by fine acidity.",Wildwood Vineyard,86,27.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,,,Kunde 2011 Wildwood Vineyard Chardonnay (Sonoma Valley),Chardonnay,Kunde
64996,US,"This is a sound, everyday Merlot with some special qualities that give it an extra point or two. It's dry and smooth in tannins, with layers of cherries, blackberries, currants and licorice. Not likely to age well, so give it a little time to breathe and drink now.",Limited Production,86,20.0,California,Central Coast,Central Coast,,,Magistrate 2011 Limited Production Merlot (Central Coast),Merlot,Magistrate
64997,US,"This is a good wine, but it relies too much on oak, overwhelming it with buttered toast and caramel. The result is a rich but unbalanced wine, with underlying orange, pineapple and peach flavors.",Silhouette,86,65.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Merryvale 2010 Silhouette Chardonnay (Napa Valley),Chardonnay,Merryvale
64998,Spain,"This Tempranillo is forward in style, with leather, cherry, plum and smoky aromas. It feels racy and healthy, with buttery oak, vanilla, herb and mild raspberry and red plum flavors. This is good as a whole, with no one characteristic sticking out.",Sangre de Toro,86,12.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Torres 2011 Sangre de Toro Tempranillo (Catalunya),Tempranillo,Torres
64999,Spain,"Apple, lime, lemon and natural vanilla are the aromas one gets from this blended Catalonian white. The palate is bright along the edges, a bit soft and jumbled in the middle, and in terms of flavor the wine offers generic apple and lime in front of a fresh but fleshy finish. Drink immediately.",Sangre de Toro Viña Sol,86,12.0,Catalonia,Catalunya,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Torres 2011 Sangre de Toro Viña Sol White (Catalunya),White Blend,Torres
