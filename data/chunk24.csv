124962,Australia,"Seemingly fully mature, this wine features lots of savory, meaty notes to go along with dried fruit aromas, then adds brighter, tart berry flavors on the palate. Vanilla, tobacco and crisp acids seem to be taking control of the finish, so drink up before the fruit fades.",Frux Frugis,89,60.0,South Australia,McLaren Vale,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Ulithorne 2003 Frux Frugis Shiraz (McLaren Vale),Shiraz,Ulithorne
124963,Italy,Gaglioppo is naturally light and lean in color and can be consumed a few degrees cooler than your standard red wine. This wine is an excellent example of the variety with clean notes of forest berry and cola. The wine is lean but determined and refreshing.,,88,18.0,Southern Italy,Calabria,,,,Statti 2007 Gaglioppo (Calabria),Gaglioppo,Statti
124964,Australia,"This unusual blend is 68% Shiraz and 32% Malbec, resulting in a full-bodied, deeply plummy wine. Hints of clove, pepper and earth impart welcome complexity on the nose, while the flavors fold in a black olive component. Softly tannic, so drink now or hold 2-3 years.",Organic,88,15.0,South Australia,Langhorne Creek,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,Temple Bruer 2005 Organic Shiraz-Malbec (Langhorne Creek),Shiraz-Malbec,Temple Bruer
124965,Italy,"This aged Nero d'Avola delivers sophisticated tones of cherry liqueur, asphalt, resin, coffee bean, dried prunes and plums. The wine delivers personality and charm with a silky, elegant feel in the mouth. The integrity of fruit probably won't last much longer, so don't wait long to drink it.",Signorio,88,36.0,Sicily & Sardinia,Sicilia,,,,Tenuta Barone Nicolò La Lumia 2003 Signorio Nero d'Avola (Sicilia),Nero d'Avola,Tenuta Barone Nicolò La Lumia
124966,US,"With a high bite of acidity and bright, focused fruit, this Pinot Gris defines the white wines of the Edna Ranch, and the wider Edna Valley. The wildflower, lemon, lime, green apple, sage and white pepper flavors have a honeyed edge, but the wine is bone dry.",Edna Ranch,88,19.0,California,Edna Valley,Central Coast,,,Tolosa 2007 Edna Ranch Pinot Gris (Edna Valley),Pinot Gris,Tolosa
124967,Argentina,"Good red fruit on the opening and spicy. Ripe, intense and warming in the mouth, with a broad-sweeping wave of plum and raspberry. Feels a little creamy and then drying on the finish, with medium depth and lasting heat. Due to high alcohol and a related burn it needs food, i.e. anything off the grill.",,88,15.0,Mendoza Province,Mendoza,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Tomero 2006 Malbec (Mendoza),Malbec,Tomero
124968,Italy,"There are ripe notes here of blackberry preserves, blueberry tart, chocolate and black stone that accompany this wine over its long finish. The wine has jackhammer tannins and enormous structure that need a few more years in the bottle to soften up.",Gudarrá,88,,Southern Italy,Aglianico del Vulture,,,,Bisceglia 2005 Gudarrá  (Aglianico del Vulture),Aglianico,Bisceglia
124969,Italy,"This pretty Chardonnay from Sicily (that sees six months in oak) delivers notes of apricot, banana, peach and a touch of playful exotic spice in the background.

124970,Portugal,"A dark, brooding style of tannic Douro wine. It is lean initially, with a strong mineral character and firm black plum-skin flavors plus leather and tight acidity. When it opens out, this becomes a great value from the Douro.",Vega,88,10.0,Douro,,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,DFJ Vinhos 2005 Vega Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,DFJ Vinhos
124971,Portugal,"Pinot Noir and Portugal don't normally go together, but DFJ seem to have made a specialty of growing this variety in the cooler Estremadura region.

124972,Argentina,"Ripe, full, sweet, oaky and even a touch confectionary, with a whiff of cotton candy blending with resin and spice from the barrels. The palate is superconcentrated, with blackberry and chocolate flavors, and on the finish the oak pushes things toward toast, coconut and burnt logs. Woody, but powerful and appealing.",Synthesis,88,35.0,Mendoza Province,Tupungato,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Finca Sophenia 2007 Synthesis Malbec (Tupungato),Malbec,Finca Sophenia
124973,US,"Nothing has quite reached the heights of the original release of this wine, but every version has been solidly made by winemaker Rich Funk of Saviah. This is sleek, firm, with cassis and tart red berries. The balance is fine and the finish is clean and shows just a hint of baking chocolate.

124974,US,"An absolutely first-rate Pinot Noir that's perfect for drinking now and over the next year or so.

124975,Italy,"There's a black, inky quality to this wine thanks to its immediate mineral notes of black stone and slate.

124976,US,"The Columbia Valley Cuvée is JM Cellars' Bordeaux blend of Cab, Merlot and Cab Franc.

124977,US,"Very ripe, with powerful grilled blackberry, cassis and smoky oak flavors that are wrapped into strong tannins.

124978,US,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah is the best of the three new releases from Mannina. It simply has better focus, more concentration and is a well-balanced wine with a pretty mocha/toasty finish. Why is this the cheap wine?

124979,US,"Dark, smoky and herbal, this wine, the second Malbec from Maryhill, does capture some of that grape's lovely character. Tart wild berry fruit is cut with sharp acids, and laced with herb and hints of stone. There is a bit of saddle leather showing through the tannins, but not so much as to wipe out the sweet fruit. A persistent finish tastes like fresh picked raspberries.",Proprietor's Reserve,88,40.0,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Columbia Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Maryhill 2005 Proprietor's Reserve Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA)),Malbec,Maryhill
124980,US,"Made in a cool part of Napa Valley in a cool vintage, this Syrah is very dry and tough in youthful tannins. It's too astringent to offer much pleasure now, but has a great heart of ripe blackberry, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco, anise and pepper flavor that should sweeten and emerge as the wine ages. Try holding until after 2009.",,88,40.0,California,Oak Knoll District,Napa,,,Moffett 2005 Syrah (Oak Knoll District),Syrah,Moffett
124981,Argentina,"Rubber and savory berry aromas lead it off. The palate shows good texture and overall smoothness, with round cassis and plum flavors.
