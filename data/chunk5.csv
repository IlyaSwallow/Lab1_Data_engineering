29966,US,"Sourced from the Glenrose Vineyard and aged for three years in 132-gallon puncheons before extended bottle time, this memorable wine offers leather, red cherry, rust, pencil lead and vanilla bean on the sanguine nose.

29967,France,"This delicious wine, on the dry side of brut, is fresh and fruity while also finely textured. Initially, it seems light and then more complex minerality and steely acidity come through to give a structure that promises aging.

29969,Argentina,"Intensely dark in color, this syrupy rich, extracted Malbec pushes the envelope of max ripeness via heady balsamic aromas of leather, blackberry and cassis. The palate couldn't be much riper, while heavy oak means flavors of chocolate, vanilla and wood grain are as prominent as the wine's massive berry fruit components.

29971,US,"A big, dry wine rich in red fruit and sizable tannins, this 100% varietal, single-vineyard designated offering is buoyed by silky, fine-grained tannins that support its voluptuous nature.

29972,Chile,"Aromas of nettle, gooseberry, grapefruit and mineral are sharp, distinct and varietally appropriate, while the wet, short palate is hollow but edged by green apple, gooseberry and other green fruit flavors.

29977,Chile,"Green aromas blend with coastal-influenced passion fruit, while the palate is driven by citrus, pineapple, passion fruit and some unfortunate canned vegetable flavors.

29985,Italy,"Amarone sometimes benefits from a tiny dash of volatility (that usually comes across with aromas that resemble red apple or cider), but in this case those notes have turned to apple sauce and ultimately distract from the overall picture.
