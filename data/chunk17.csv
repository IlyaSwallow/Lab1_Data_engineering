85001,Spain,"Didn't much like the 2005 basic Tempranillo from Vall Sanzo and this twice-as-expensive Ribera Del Duero isn't much better. It starts out heavily gaseous, with aromas of wet clay and roasted fruit.

85002,US,"The blazing vintage took its toll on this high altitude wine.

85004,Spain,"Mulchy aromas of tomato and tobacco lead toward a raisiny, sweet palate that exhibits more than a touch of burnt character.

85005,Spain,"Starts out severely jumbled and hot, and while it always remains clumsy and over-the-top, it settles into a tolerable medicinal, syrupy sort of mode.

85006,Spain,"A wide-open, jumbled rosé without much focus or charm. There's peppery heat on the nose and then a lemony, citrusy palate that's at first soda-like and later kind of flat.

The residual sugar is at 23%, the alcohol a moderate 8%, and the balance impeccable, with a buoyant underpinning to the intense sweetness. It avoids sugary granularity as well, offering seamless, concentrated fruit that piles on flavors of peach, apricot, banana, mango, papaya and melon in wild profusion, trailing into sweet tea and honey.

The naturally tannic Sagrantino grape is softened by the careful oak aging that adds layers of chocolate and spice to the grape's aromas of black cherry, tobacco and leather.

However, the wine isn't a mere fruit bomb. It has interesting nuances of earthy things, like mushrooms, nettles and Provençal herbs. The silky texture is an exquisite balance of acids and tannins.

88859,US,"The winery held this back an additional six months after their other 2008 Pinots were released, presumably to let it become integrated. Still, it's quite tannic, with a sandpaper-like toughness. Despite the astringency, the massive wild-cherry, cola, mushroom and anise flavors come through. It's a huge wine, feral and untamed—quite exquisite in its wildness.

It's noted the vines were planted in 1970, and the wine does have that old-vine concentration of fruit in the form of massively intense blackberries. Then there's the smoky new oak, which adds such a lusciously sweet jacket of buttered toast.

88865,US,"This portion of the winery's vineyard always yields Cabernets of enormous concentration with hard tannins. The 2009 is a classic, detonating in the mouth with laserlike blackberry and cassis flavors, to which new oak brings additional richness of smoky cedar.

88866,US,"While this Pinot is huge in fruit and has a big, heavyweight mouthfeel, somehow it never loses its sense of delicacy and charm. The flavors are the essence of cherries: ripe, sweet and intense. This richness is balanced by the earthiness of a wild mushroom risotto. With brilliant acidity, it's a wonderfully rewarding wine, easily on par with the 2009, perhaps a shade better.

This is like a self-generating well of freshness that convinces with its luminosity, raciness and rapier-like purity of citrus flavors. Everything is heightened: Fruit, dryness, freshness and vibrant verve. It is tempting but it would be a shame to drink this now.

This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure.

On the absolutely dry palate, however, a beautifully lithe, serene but all-encompassing cloud of lemon freshness just steals the show. It pervades and informs nose, palate and mind. Its luminosity and vivacious freshness just soars and sings. Yes, this is uncompromising. You have to like freshness, acidity and unflinching honesty to be a fan of this, but if you are, this is a ticket to vinous heaven. Wow.

While very young, this holds all it needs for a promising future: A bright core of juicy fruit—think tangerine, tart red apple and ripe yellow pear—as well as the vividly clean and racy freshness of bright lemon. This is concentrated and rather powerful, rapier-like in its cleansing, dry finish but also generous on its fruity midpalate. This is confident and self-assured and stands tall with its powerful structure and body. Leave this to calm down and become itself.

All these notions continue to play on the very zesty, thoroughly aromatic palate. Citrus flesh and peel shimmers and swirls across mind and palate, creating a dreamy, heightened cloud of fragrant freshness. The palate is just off dry and lip-smackingly bright and fresh.
