39970,US,"Floral, spicy and sweet on the nose, and with a straightforward, refreshing blend of typical Riesling flavors, this wine is dependable and pretty, and will pair well with spicy Asian and Indian cuisine. A touch sweet but clean.",,84,22.0,Michigan,Leelanau Peninsula,,Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa,Jana 2007 Riesling (Leelanau Peninsula),Riesling,Jana

39972,US,"An elegant nose of deep spice and fruit leads on this Meritage from the Snake River Valley of Idaho—an emerging region to watch for interesting reds. The wine offers sturdy red fruit, spice and structure, and seems made for hearty fare like grilled steaks or, if you feel like splurging, a kobe burger.",Cuvée Alden Private Reserve Red,84,50.0,Idaho,,,Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa,Koenig Vineyards 2004 Cuvée Alden Private Reserve Red Meritage,Meritage,Koenig Vineyards
39973,Spain,"A bit funky and gassy on the nose, and while the wine offers ripeness and sweetness on the palate, there's always a little something strange and sulfuric lingering. It has its plum and acidity, but the tannins and overall mouthfeel are grabby.",Joven,84,14.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Martín Berdugo 2006 Joven  (Ribera del Duero),Tempranillo Blend,Martín Berdugo
39974,US,"With just a touch of oak, this is a pretty good Sauvignon Blanc. It's a little sweet in fig, citrus, passionfruit and melon flavors, but those Monterey acids are brisk and provide a clean balance.",,84,15.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,,,Morgan 2007 Sauvignon Blanc (Monterey),Sauvignon Blanc,Morgan
39975,Australia,"De Bortoli's unique approach to harvest timing and extensive use of new oak leaves this wine seeming rather disjointed: coffee and cola notes dominate the tart, cranberryish fruit flavors. I suspect it will show better with a few years' of cellaring, but until then, I remain unconvinced.",Reserve Release,84,60.0,Victoria,Yarra Valley,,Joe Czerwinski,@JoeCz,De Bortoli 2006 Reserve Release Pinot Noir (Yarra Valley),Pinot Noir,De Bortoli
39976,US,"This wine is a solid, stylish Meritage with assertive red fruit, a black pepper backbone and plenty of structure for aging. A touch of oaked spice adds dimension. A good overall red to pair with hearty winter fare.",Red Table Wine,84,25.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa,Atwater 2005 Red Table Wine Meritage (Finger Lakes),Meritage,Atwater
39977,US,"There's a disagreeable sharpness and harshness to this Merlot. Despite some pleasant cherry, berry and oak flavors and a lush texture, that rough tartness persists through the finish.",,84,30.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,,,Bell 2004 Merlot (Napa Valley),Merlot,Bell
39978,US,"Smoky, elegant and soft aromas of leather, pepper and berry lead into flavors of cherry and cigarbox spice on the palate of this approachable Cabernet. The wine is not terribly complex, but good structure and acidity give it cellaring potential, and paired with duck, lamb or beef dishes, it will make a very nice addition to the table.",,84,19.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa,Bellangelo 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon (Finger Lakes),Cabernet Sauvignon,Bellangelo
39979,Spain,"Warm and earthy at first, but more soupy as it opens. Crisp, snappy red-fruit flavors are also on the herbal side. Nervy yet it does show a reasonable amount of honest Rioja quality. Still, for a 2001 reserva it doesn't amount to much.",Reserva,84,18.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Castillo Clavijo 2001 Reserva  (Rioja),Tempranillo Blend,Castillo Clavijo

39982,Spain,"Burnt oak, tire rubber and bramble vie with blackberry and vanilla aromas. The palate is brambly and a little lean, with strawberry and raspberry flavors taking on some grassy wildness. Simply stated, the fruit flavors just aren't of the highest order.

39983,US,"Big spice and blackberry/cherry aromas start this wine out right, and on the palate, a rustic underlay of tobacco and pepper adds character.

39985,US,"Lemon citrus, toast, white flowers—the lead on this wine is feminine and light and, as the name suggests, feels like a warm weather match.

39986,Spain,"Slightly prickly and peppery on the nose, but there's enough clean red-fruit aromas and dustiness to bring it along. The palate is simple and nice enough, with tight acidity, stanching dryness and zest. A good but limited wine that delivers what it should but nothing beyond that.",,84,10.0,Northern Spain,Rioja,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Darien 2006  Rioja,Tempranillo,Darien
39987,Spain,"Quite tannic and biting, but beyond those mouthfeel issues this affordable RDD has its positives. The bouquet of toast, mocha and coconut is alluring, and then the palate of dark-fruit flavors, while rock-hard, is masculine. But never does one escape the feel and balance shortcomings. It's a like a ride down a pocked and bumpy gravel road.",Monte Castrillo,84,13.0,Northern Spain,Ribera del Duero,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Finca Torremilanos 2006 Monte Castrillo  (Ribera del Duero),Tempranillo Blend,Finca Torremilanos
39988,US,"Cherry and mocha on the nose start this wine nicely, and the flavors to follow—cherry, pepper, spice—are balanced and elegant. The tannins are somewhat aggressive and need time to soften.

39992,US,"How's this for exotic: this red blend is made from the vinifera grapes Saperavi (from the former Soviet Georgia) and Sereksiya Charni (generally from Moldova). On the nose, the wine displays clove, tart berry, raspberry and black pepper, and on the palate, like flavors and solid tannins. There's a touch of dried tea to the blend and a decent finish, but the wine needs time to age--consider holding it for 5-10 years for the complexity to unfold. Overall, an appealing and interesting choice.",Black Russian Red,84,60.0,New York,Finger Lakes,Finger Lakes,Susan Kostrzewa,@suskostrzewa,McGregor 2005 Black Russian Red Red (Finger Lakes),Red Blend,McGregor

39994,Italy,"A blend of Tintore and Per'e Palummo (a grape native to the Island of Ischia), there is a thorny, raw quality to this wine that is backed by Asian spice, incense, spice, tobacco and mature black fruit.
