44989,France,"Brambles and undergrowth aromas give this wine a curious character reflected in the wild strawberry flavors that are not linked to the tannins. This seven-acre Thienpont family property is run by Jan, who has several wine projects, and Florian, who came to wine as a chef.",,81,,Bordeaux,Francs Côtes de Bordeaux,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Château La Marotte 2013  Francs Côtes de Bordeaux,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château La Marotte
44990,Spain,"The aroma is stalky and leathery on the nose. The palate is grabby, with sulfuric, bitter flavors of uncomplicated berry fruits. This is 65% Bobal and 35% Tempranillo.",Ananto,80,9.0,Levante,Utiel-Requena,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Sierra Norte 2012 Ananto Red (Utiel-Requena),Red Blend,Sierra Norte
44991,Chile,"This wine is volatile and grassy on the nose, and extremely horsey. Odd flavors of mango and pineapple are way out of place, and the finish tastes of bad tobacco.",Gran Reserva,80,14.0,Colchagua Valley,,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Viu Manent 2012 Gran Reserva Malbec (Colchagua Valley),Malbec,Viu Manent
44992,Spain,"This Cava is so heavily oaked that it smells savory and saucy, with almost no fruit to speak of. Woody flavors are barrel-dominated, and so is the monotonous finish.",Brut Nature,80,17.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Torre Oria NV Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava),Sparkling Blend,Torre Oria
44993,Spain,"Scattered, dusty, yeasty aromas of mustard and apple are less than welcoming. This feels choppy and strained, with vanilla and white-fruit flavors.",Brut,80,13.0,Catalonia,Cava,,Michael Schachner,@wineschach,Conde de Subirats NV Brut Sparkling (Cava),Sparkling Blend,Conde de Subirats
44994,Italy,"This stunning wine is all about extreme elegance and subtlety. It opens with aromas of wild red berry, rose petal, sweet baking spice and a whiff aromatic herb while the focused palate delivers red cherry, crushed raspberry, licorice, pipe tobacco and white pepper. A firm backbone of polished tannins and vibrant acidity gives it an age-worthy structure. It's loaded with finesse and should develop even more complexity over time.

44995,France,"This young wine is all magnificent structure. It is intense, with fruit and acidity given richness by the powerful texture and tense tannins. The dense symphony of ripe fruits is kept in check by the structure.

44996,France,"Fermented and aged in six-year old wood for 24 months, this is a richly spicy wine. The wood is there to smell and taste, but it is the rich fruit that speaks. Yellow fruits are given weight by the mineral backdrop, while layers of acidity instill freshness.

44997,France,"This is a beautiful wine with elegant fruits that reflect a strong sense of minerality. It is crisp, although that is just a surface quality to a wine that has such depth. Toast flavors round out the intense fruits, giving a light spice and butter to this powerful wine.

44998,France,"With its great richness, the wine is opulent, generous and full of powerful fruits. The wood aging and the toastiness have done nothing to diminish the yellow fruit and crisp apple flavors. It's an impressive and concentrated wine that will age for many years.

44999,Italy,"A hallmark bottling from one of Serralunga's prime vineyard sites, this gorgeous Barolo has structure, breeding and class. It opens with classic aromas of perfumed berry, leather, forest floor, tobacco and a balsamic note while the impeccable palate delivers wild cherry, crushed raspberry, strawberry, chopped herb, white pepper and licorice. It's still tight and tannic so give it time to fully develop to is full, amazing potential.
