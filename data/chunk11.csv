59991,France,"The lifted nose seems like an amalgam of chalk and dried apples along with lemon zest. The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long. This is an experience rather than a drink. Drink now through 2035.",Schoenenbourg Grand Cru,95,98.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2011 Schoenenbourg Grand Cru White (Alsace),Alsace white blend,Domaine Marcel Deiss
59992,US,"Seductive and velvety, this concentrated Pinot Noir is richly layered in raspberry cherry cordial, cardamom and cola flavors. Pine and allspice notes contribute a homey spiciness as as the fullness of the wine lingers into a long finish.",Year of the Horse Single Vineyard,95,72.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Donum 2014 Year of the Horse Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,Donum
59993,Italy,"Forest floor, aromatic herb, dark spice and eucalyptus aromas come together with a floral twist. Bright and elegant, the palate shows succulent wild cherry, white pepper, star anise and chopped mint flavors. With its taut, fine-grained tannins and firm acidity, it needs time to unwind and fully develop.

59994,US,"A perennial standout, this Syrah is cofermented with 10% Viognier, all fruit sourced from a site on the western edge of Sonoma Mountain in the cool confines of the Petaluma Gap. Beautiful and bold, it imparts a focused line of blackberry and lavender flavors over a lush backdrop of sizzling acidity and smoked meat scents.",Rodgers Creek Vineyard,95,75.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Ramey 2013 Rodgers Creek Vineyard Syrah (Sonoma Coast),Syrah,Ramey
59995,US,"Coming from this exceptional winery the term reserve (or in this case, riservata) actually means a great deal. Flavors are broad and deep and entwined with plum, cherry compote, soy and chocolate. The length and power are impressive: these flavors just don't quit.",Estate Riservata,95,45.0,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Willamette Valley,Paul Gregutt,@paulgwine ,Alloro 2014 Estate Riservata Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains),Pinot Noir,Alloro
59996,US,"This wine defines luxurious texture, at once velvety, richly layered and bright. From one of the warmer sites in a cool climate zone, it complements its fruit concentration with deeper sarsaparilla, vanilla, tea and cardamom scents, the finish delightfully playful in orange peel accents.",UV Lucky Well Vineyard,95,75.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Virginie Boone,@vboone,Arista 2014 UV Lucky Well Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,Arista
59997,France,Initial tight acidity in this crisp wine gives way to smooth rich black fruits. This already has a fine balance with its ripe juiciness and delicious red-berry flavors. It is going to develop into a very fine wine.

59998,France,"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body. The finish is endless and very fruity. Have this with cheese or a subtle dessert.

59999,France,"The nose is still shy but already tells of tender sweetness. The palate has a rounded earthy smoky element that grounds the luscious generous fruit of dried pear and supersweet Reine Claude and mirabelle plums. The sweetness of this SGN is balanced and almost fresh, but the intriguing thing is a kind of smoky, dark and mysterious core of stone.",Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Sélection de Grains Nobles Larme de Lave,95,90.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Anne Krebiehl MW,@AnneInVino,Domaine Schoffit 2007 Clos Saint-Théobald Grand Cru Rangen Sélection de Grains Nobles Larme de Lave Pinot Gris (Alsace),Pinot Gris,Domaine Schoffit
